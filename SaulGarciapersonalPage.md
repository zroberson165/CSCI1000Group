Welcome to my personal page for the group project!

## About Me
I am a Computer Science major at the University of Colorado Boulder with a passion for game design.
I hope to be able to graduate in 4 or 5 years. 
Currently I am trying to gain experience in the CS world, buy starting my leetcode project and cybersecurity program in the summer of 2025. 

## Skills Used
- Programming Languages: C++, Python
- Tools: Git, VS Code
- Frameworks: SFML for graphics

## Challenges Faced
One of the biggest challenges I faced was resolving merge conflicts when integrating my code into the repository. I overcame this by carefully reviewing the changes and coordinating with teammates.

## Reflection
This project taught me the importance of effective communication in teamwork and helped me improve my Git skills, especially resolving conflicts and managing branches. Which could be a vitial source for future interships.
