            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Computer Science major at the University of Colorado Boulder with a passion for game design. 
                I hope to be able to graduate in 4 or 5 years. 
                Currently, I am trying to gain experience in the CS world by starting my Leetcode project and cybersecurity program in the summer of 2025.

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges I faced was resolving merge conflicts when integrating my code into the repository. 
                I overcame this by carefully reviewing the changes and coordinating with teammates.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This project taught me the importance of effective communication in teamwork and helped me improve my Git skills, 
                especially resolving conflicts and managing branches. 
                This could be a vital resource for future internships. 
                I also learned more about .html and creating websites. 
                Along with that, I was able to realize how much more I could do with VS Code.
